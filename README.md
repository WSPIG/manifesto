# West Seattle PIG (Programming Interest Group)

This is intented to be a low commitment group providing a place to practice and  develop skills we care about, through collaborative contribution or creation of OSS, and to network with like-minded people in the area.

We'd like to hold monthly in-person meetings, and organize around a mailing list and an organization github account.

We'd like to work on common projects. Ideal projects would have a duration between 6 and 16 weeks, in an effort to strike a balance between choosing interesting yet manageable projects.

##  What we are interested in:

* languages: interested in exploring new paradigms. For us right now that means expressive, repl, functional programming.
* problems related to data, AI (broadly speaking), generally
  interesting algorithms, distributed programming.
* tools and technologies: if newer, convention breaking, prob good.
